### Description

Hi this is a simple little project that I made as part of a program I am makeing. well what this code allows you do do is create a Text logo with a Textured foreground colour. I seen lots of exaples were people have used gradient colour but never texture well I have never got them work. well this ones works quite well and is also quite fast anyway see what you think please vote for me if you like this code.
